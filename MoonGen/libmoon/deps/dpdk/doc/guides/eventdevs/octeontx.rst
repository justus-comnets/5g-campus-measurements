OCTEONTX SSOVF Eventdev Driver
==============================

The OCTEONTX SSOVF PMD (**librte_pmd_octeontx_ssovf**) provides poll mode
eventdev driver support for the inbuilt event device found in the **Cavium OCTEONTX**
SoC family as well as their virtual functions (VF) in SR-IOV context.

More information can be found at `Cavium, Inc Official Website
<http://www.cavium.com/OCTEON-TX_ARM_Processors.html>`_.

Features
--------

Features of the OCTEONTX SSOVF PMD are:

- 64 Event queues
- 32 Event ports
- HW event scheduler
- Supports 1M flows per event queue
- Flow based event pipelining
- Flow pinning support in flow based event pipelining
- Queue based event pipelining
- Supports ATOMIC, ORDERED, PARALLEL schedule types per flow
- Event scheduling QoS based on event queue priority
- Open system with configurable amount of outstanding events
- HW accelerated dequeue timeout support to enable power management
- SR-IOV VF

Supported OCTEONTX SoCs
-----------------------
- CN83xx

Prerequisites
-------------

There are three main pre-perquisites for executing SSOVF PMD on a OCTEONTX
compatible board:

1. **OCTEONTX Linux kernel PF driver for Network acceleration HW blocks**

   The OCTEONTX Linux kernel drivers (including the required PF driver for the
   SSOVF) are available on Github at `octeontx-kmod <https://github.com/caviumnetworks/octeontx-kmod>`_
   along with build, install and dpdk usage instructions.

2. **ARM64 Tool Chain**

   For example, the *aarch64* Linaro Toolchain, which can be obtained from
   `here <https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/4.9-2017.01/aarch64-linux-gnu>`_.

3. **Rootfile system**

   Any *aarch64* supporting filesystem can be used. For example,
   Ubuntu 15.10 (Wily) or 16.04 LTS (Xenial) userland which can be obtained
   from `<http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-base/releases/16.04/release/ubuntu-base-16.04.1-base-arm64.tar.gz>`_.

   As an alternative method, SSOVF PMD can also be executed using images provided
   as part of SDK from Cavium. The SDK includes all the above prerequisites necessary
   to bring up a OCTEONTX board.

   SDK and related information can be obtained from: `Cavium support site <https://support.cavium.com/>`_.

- Follow the DPDK :ref:`Getting Started Guide for Linux <linux_gsg>` to setup the basic DPDK environment.

Pre-Installation Configuration
------------------------------

Config File Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following options can be modified in the ``config`` file.
Please note that enabling debugging options may affect system performance.

- ``CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_PMD_OCTEONTX_SSOVF`` (default ``y``)

  Toggle compilation of the ``librte_pmd_octeontx_ssovf`` driver.

- ``CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_PMD_OCTEONTX_SSOVF_DEBUG`` (default ``n``)

  Toggle display of generic debugging messages

Driver Compilation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To compile the OCTEONTX SSOVF PMD for Linux arm64 gcc target, run the
following ``make`` command:

.. code-block:: console

   cd <DPDK-source-directory>
   make config T=arm64-thunderx-linuxapp-gcc install


Initialization
--------------

The octeontx eventdev is exposed as a vdev device which consists of a set
of SSO group and work-slot PCIe VF devices. On EAL initialization,
SSO PCIe VF devices will be probed and then the vdev device can be created
from the application code, or from the EAL command line based on
the number of probed/bound SSO PCIe VF device to DPDK by

* Invoking ``rte_vdev_init("event_octeontx")`` from the application

* Using ``--vdev="event_octeontx"`` in the EAL options, which will call
  rte_vdev_init() internally

Example:

.. code-block:: console

    ./your_eventdev_application --vdev="event_octeontx"

Limitations
-----------

Burst mode support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Burst mode is not supported. Dequeue and Enqueue functions accepts only single
event at a time.
